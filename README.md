# Appointment-Booker
## Description:
Java application to hold and make appointments for a gym subscription class. Add the courses and let people choose which ones to take (max 2-3 ppl?). Courses could be written as a class with a course name, trainer name, cost, day and time that it runs for. Then user could use the calender GUI to navigate available courses and click on them to book it given their information: name, DOB, payment, subscription status for discount. 

### Purpose:
A program that could schedule gym courses and organize it to.

### Requirements:
1. GUI that shows all classes
2. Can click on elements and sort everything based on that (sort by closest/furthest appointment dates)
3. Add appointments and return errors if times overlap for same trainer/off days
4. Maybe make overall GUI just a calender with a list view option (staff view)

### Ideas:
maybe sync to google calender when appointment created

## Week 1:
Do CRC cards for the project.
List requirements
Look for ways to implements learning outcomes
