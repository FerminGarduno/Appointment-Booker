# Appointment-Booker
## Description:
Java application for the user to make appointments for predetermined courses with set times and dates. Written and collaborated by Zhanhang Xiao and Fermin Garduno

### Purpose:
A program that could schedule gym courses for a local gym. Add the courses and let people choose which ones to take (max 2-3 ppl?). Courses could be written as a class with a course name, trainer name, cost, day and time that it runs for. Then user could use the calender GUI to navigate available courses and click on them to book it given their information: name, DOB, payment, subscription status for discount. Customer information could also be a class. 

### Requirements:
1. GUI that user can use to choose and pay for a course
2. Can click on elements and sort everything based on that (sort by closest/furthest appointment dates)
3. Add appointments and return errors if times overlap for same trainer/off days
4. Maybe make overall GUI just a calender with a list view option (staff view)

### Ideas:
see if we can use google calender itself as the gui

## Week 1:
Do CRC cards for the project.
List requirements
Look for ways to implements learning outcomes
